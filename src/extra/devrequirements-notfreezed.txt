##### python requirements (not freezed) for dev environment #####
# Format: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/
# and https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers
#
# In the "common makefiles" logic, this file should define
# dev dependencies in a loose way (for example without version numbering or
# with a flexible version numbering like ">=1.2,<2.0" ). You should
# avoid exact version numbering here (example: "==1.2.3") because strict
# requirements are automatically generated in another file: "devrequirements.txt"
# (including dependencies of requirements).

# As "devrequirements.txt" is automatically generated, this current file should
# be manually maintained.

# keep this line (devenv must only extend runenv)
-r requirements.txt

# Some interesting linters and tools for python devenv
# (feel free to remove some or all of them)
